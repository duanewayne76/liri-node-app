# liri-node-app

LIRI bot is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI uses the Spotify, Bands in Town Artist Events and the IMDB APIs along with Node.
